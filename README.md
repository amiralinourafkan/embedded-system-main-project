Project Description:
This project is a bracelet that involves designing a tactile and light warning system that when the system is on the hand of a deaf person, when there is a danger or a doorbell or a phone call, the bracelet starts to vibrate. When the sensor vibrates, a light also shines and that light also changes to specific colors based on the event.
For example, the doorbell should be yellow, the wake-up call should be white, the phone call should be orange, the emergency call (e.g. fire) should be red, etc. When a deaf person uses the system, he should memorize the color chart based on the type of alarm to understand what has happened. When no one is home and only the deaf person is home, all the phone calls, doorbells, and emergency calls should be connected to the system.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To make a vibrating and light bracelet for the deaf, you can use the following components:

1. Sound sensors
   • Electromagnetic microphone: such as MAX9814 or LM393 to detect sounds.
   • Sound sensor: such as Sound Sensor Module which is easy to use.

2. Microcontroller
   • Arduino Uno or Arduino Nano: to process data and control other components.
   • ESP32: if you want to add wireless capabilities (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth).

3. Vibration Model
   • Vibration Motor: Like the vibrator motors found in smartphones.
   • Small Vibrator Motor: Like Cylindrical Vibration Motor.

4. Light Model
   • LEDs: Colored LEDs (such as red, green, blue) to display alerts.
   • RGB LED: To produce different colors with one LED.

5. Power Supply
   • Lithium-ion (Li-ion) or Lithium-Polymer (Li-Po) battery: To power the device.
   • Battery Charger Module: Like TP4056 to charge the battery.

6. Circuit and Connections
   • Printed Circuit Board (PCB) or Breadboard: To build the circuit.
   • Jumper Wires: To connect components together.

7. Other Components
   • Resistors and Capacitors: To adjust and filter signals.
   • Potentiometer: To adjust microphone sensitivity.
   • Push Button: To turn the device on/off or other settings.

8. Box and Body
   • Plastic or silicone box: To place and protect the parts.
   • Wrist strap: For comfortable use on the wrist
